I made this website on Visual Studio Code. I used style.css to modify the texture and the colors of the pages of website.
Selecting the different colors of each page of website,I made it unique!
To make the text italic,I used <i> for it.
To highlight the text,I used <mark> for it.
To make the text strong I used <strong>.
